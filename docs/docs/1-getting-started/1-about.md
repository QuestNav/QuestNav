# About QuestNav

QuestNav enables streaming Oculus VR headset pose information to an FRC robot using the Network Tables 4 (NT4) protocol. This pose data provides robot control systems with accurate mapping and navigation capabilities in competition fields, practice spaces, or any location.

:::info
QuestNav produces a more stable and reliable tracking pose than any other FRC vision solution (LimeLight, Photon Vision, etc.), making it an ideal choice for teams seeking precise robot localization.

## Key Benefits

- More stable and reliable tracking than other FRC vision solutions
- Lower cost compared to most FRC vision solutions
- Multiple SLAM cameras for redundant, calibrated VIO (Visual Inertial Odometry)
- Camera tracking fused with onboard IMU for accurate position and velocity estimates
- Up to 120Hz robot odometry refresh rate (linked to the Quest headset framerate)
- Powered by [Qualcomm XR2G2 platform](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/xr-vr-ar/snapdragon-xr2-gen-2-platform) with multiple CPU/GPU cores, 8GB RAM, dedicated video hardware, and 128GB+ storage
- Well-supported ecosystem with off-the-shelf 3D mapping libraries
- Self-contained, rechargeable battery

:::tip
The Quest 3S headset is recommended for FRC applications due to its lower cost and excellent tracking performance. The depth projector on the Quest 3 doesn't provide significant benefits for robot navigation.

## How It Works

QuestNav uses the Quest headset's Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) system - the same technology that powers VR gaming - to track position in 3D space with remarkable accuracy. The system:

1. Captures visual data through the headset's cameras
2. Combines this with inertial data from the built-in IMU
3. Processes this information to determine position and orientation in real-time
4. Transmits this data to the robot via a wired Ethernet connection
5. Makes the information available through Network Tables for robot code to use

:::note
The same technology that prevents motion sickness in VR by precisely tracking head movements is now used to track your robot's position with high precision.

## Software Architecture

QuestNav implements a simple bidirectional communication structure between the VR headset and robot, enabling:
- Heading/pose reset requests
- Configuration updates
- Ping functionality
- Real-time pose data streaming
