# QuestNav Recommended USB to Ethernet Adapters

First, you'll need a USB to Ethernet adapter. The Quest 3/3s has a USB-C port that can be used for this purpose, with a dongle. It is imperative you choose from this list if possible as Android fails to enumerate some USB to Ethernet adapters as it was never designed for this purpose.

:::danger
Not all USB-C to Ethernet adapters work with the Quest! Some adapters will not be recognized by the Android operating system, making them useless for QuestNav.

## Recommended Adapters
The list below includes pictures, links, and other information for USB to Ethernet adapters known to work with Quest headsets, our most recommended choices are nearest to the top. We highly suggest that you use an adapter with power pass through to keep your headset charged during the match.

:::danger
The adapters listed above have been tested and confirmed NOT to work with Quest headsets. Do not purchase these for use with QuestNav, even if they seem similar to working models.

## Alternative Solutions

**USB Splitters with Ethernet Adapters**

:::note
Some teams have had success using USB splitters like [this one](https://a.co/d/42pHOMf) with a USB-C to Ethernet dongle. However, vibration appears to make this adapter less reliable over time. Your mileage may vary.
:::

## Testing Your Adapter

After purchasing an adapter, we recommend testing it thoroughly before competition:

1. Connect the adapter to your Quest headset
2. Connect Ethernet to your robot or development computer
3. Check if the Quest shows a valid IP address
4. Verify data transmission through Network Tables
5. Stress test by subjecting the system to vibration similar to competition conditions

:::tip
Always bring a backup adapter to competitions. Hardware failures often happen at the worst possible times!
